# Todo app

This application was made as practice on HTML, CSS, and JS, while also trying to understand redux better by implementing a simple version of it from scratch.

# Known Bugs:

- Clicking on any of the filters(All, Active, and completed) doesn't work unless there is an action dispatched such as adding a todo.
